# CovidModels
A utility to read and compare actual data from the various countries during the COVID-19 pandemic as reported to various worldwide agencies.  This utility also contains separate SEIS and SEIR epidemiological model to allow simulation of the pandemic, and was used to simulate the NSW Australia outbreak and effect of the Ruby Princess cruise ship on the spread of the virus.

This project is written in vanilla Javascript, and is installed and run on a client system. Aside from a Javascript browser, all dependancies are included in the project (ie no need for Node.js, React, jQuery etc etc). This code will consequently require CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin enabled to run.

Start by opening virusModels.html in a browser window.

This is a running program but data collection from the various government agencies has ceased. The code was developed for the Chrome browser under Microsoft Windows, so may render differently under other browsers. Limited testing has been completed under *nix and MacOS environments, with no real operability tests on the iOS environment for an iPhone and iPad.
